- Configured cocalc on tortoise to support running x11 desktops and set everyone up on the `2020-rl-game` project @bchasnov
- Created linear quadratic game gym environment with larger state space @zanedma 
- Run spinning up with custom gym environment @singerGUO
- Learn about [pytorch autograd](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html), git, cocalc @JWongDude

### Week 2
- Gradient perturbation controller @zanedma
